        <h2>Modal Verbs: Prohibition - Can't</h2>
        <p>
            Can’t is the most common way to prohibit something 
            in English. It is not as formal as must not or may 
            not, but it is the most common. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">
                You can’t drive here.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
                You can’t wear a hat in class.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
                You can’t smoke in the office.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
            Can’t is normally used to show inability, but in 
            these examples it shows prohibition. It is like 
            you are saying you do not have the ability because 
            of the rules.
        </p>

        You could also ask questions about the rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">
            Can I smoke in here?
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
            Can I park my car here?
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="possibility-may-not">
    <h2>Modal Verbs: Possibility - May Not</h2>
    <p>
        May not is the formal way to prohibit something. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">
            You may not smoke in this house.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
            You may not wear shoes in the office.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
            You may not eat in the conference room.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="possibility-may-not-questions">
    <h2>Modal Verbs: Possibility - May Not</h2>
    <p>
        Like can, you could ask questions about the rules with may:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">
            May I smoke here?
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
            May I eat in this room?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
        Because may is the most formal, you will often see it 
        in writing.
    </p>

<section id="possibility-must-not">
    <h2>Modal Verbs: Possibility - Must Not</h2>
    <p>
            This is the third way you can prohibit an action 
            or make a rule against something. 
            Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">
            You must not use a cell phone.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
            You must not write with pencil.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
            You must not play music.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
        Unlike the first two examples, you cant ask questions about rules with must.
    </p>
